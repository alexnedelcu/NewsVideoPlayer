GUI - Project 3 Part 1

Up to this point, I accomplished the following:
- implemented the GUI
- testing various APIs for search and HTML parsing

Things that I still need to work on:
- populate the program with news articles
- save/load the user defined news sources
- identify which of these news articles have video content, and which do not.\


The project was attached, and it was built in Eclipse. To run it, please load it as a new project in Eclipse.
